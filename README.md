# Data-Visualization

This README describes the Dashboards created in this repository. The dashboard and visuals are created in Tableau and IBM Cognos.


### AirBnb Analysis

In this section, an attempt has been made to analyze the Airbnb in Amsterdam. The data has been sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erikbruin/airbnb-amsterdam). The data is used to present both tourist-centric analysis and host-centric analysis. The tourist-centric analysis identifies the Airbnb best suited for tourists, while the host-centric analysis identifies pricing strategy resulting in higher profits. 

The visuals has been created in Tableau, R and Python were used for dara pre-processing and text analysis, and a PowerPoint has been created to provide insights to the key-stakeholders.
